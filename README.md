**NeuroSovereign Systems** is a next-generation, fully autonomous AI ecosystem designed to achieve true digital sovereignty. Unlike traditional AI models that rely on centralized APIs, NeuroSovereign is built to be independent, self-evolving, and capable of direct interaction with the physical and digital world.

## 🚀 Our Vision
To create an AI entity that surpasses current limitations, offering a "Sovereign Agent" capable of:
- **Complete Independence**: No reliance on external paid APIs (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.).
- **PC & System Control**: Direct interaction with operating systems, browsers, and desktop applications.
- **Live Interaction**: Real-time processing of video and audio streams for seamless human-AI collaboration.
- **Self-Evolution**: The ability to optimize its own code and reasoning patterns over time.

## 🛠 Core Architecture
The system is built on a modular architecture:
- **`src/agent.py`**: The central nervous system (Reasoning & Planning).
- **`src/llm_engine.py`**: The sovereign inference engine supporting local LLMs (Llama 3, DeepSeek, Qwen).
- **`src/pc_control.py`**: The motor cortex for system-level interactions.
- **`src/live_interaction.py`**: The sensory system for real-time data.
- **`src/self_evolution.py`**: The cognitive growth module.
